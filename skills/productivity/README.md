# Productivity

General workflow tools, not code-specific.

## User-invoked

Reachable only when you type them (Claude Code: `disable-model-invocation: true`; Codex: `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false` in `agents/openai.yaml`).

- **[grill-me](./grill-me/SKILL.md)**: Run a focused interview about a plan or decision without automatically creating domain documents.
- **[handoff](./handoff/SKILL.md)**: Preserve current scope, decisions, evidence, remaining allowance, and the next action for continuation.
- **[teach](./teach/SKILL.md)**: Teach the user a new skill or concept over multiple sessions, using the current directory as a stateful teaching workspace.
- **[to-questionnaire](./to-questionnaire/SKILL.md)**: Turn a decision you can't answer alone into a Markdown questionnaire for the one person who can (filled in async, or together over a meeting).
- **[wait-what](./wait-what/SKILL.md)**: Fire this the moment a message doesn't land. The agent re-pitches it with the context you're missing, in plain English, using your `CONTEXT.md` vocabulary.

## Model-invoked

Model- or user-reachable (rich trigger phrasing so the model can reach for them).

- **[grilling](./grilling/SKILL.md)**: Stress-test a plan through a focused interview that stops when the requested outcome is actionable.
- **[writing-for-agents](./writing-for-agents/SKILL.md)**: Writing documents for agents: skills, AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md, and any doc an agent reaches by a pointer.
